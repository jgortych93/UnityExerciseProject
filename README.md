# UnityExerciseProject

My first simple Unity 2D brick-breaker style exercise game.

Web build: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/build-78g

The purpose is to beat the best score with three lives and 5 minuts time limit.
There are a many improvements that can be done ( as textures, more levels, grafic effects, power-ups, background music, etc. ) but as mentioned this is just first exercise.

Unity version used: 2020.3.12.f1.
